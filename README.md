### Widgets for Plausible Analytics

Widgics is an open-source iOS app which enables you to add your [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/) directly on your iOS homescreen. The project is work in progress, and completion depends upon the amount of interest it generates. 

The project uses test-drive agile development processes, where requirements are turned into test cases, and code is improved upon.
